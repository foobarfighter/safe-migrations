    YOUR MIGRATION DID NOT FINISH!

You are running a migration that can be problematic unless you have taken the
proper steps to ensure that it is successful.

Read this article for more information:

If you are confident that your migration is safe, wrap your migration in a
safety_assured block.  See below:

  class MySafeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      safety_assured { remove_column :foo_table, :foo_column }
    end
  end

Have a nice day!
