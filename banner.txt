    YOUR MIGRATION DID NOT FINISH!

You are running a migration that can be problematic
unless you have taken the proper steps to ensure that
it is successful.

ActiveRecord caches attributes which can cause problems
when removing columns, adding columns or changing column
names.

Read this article for more information:

Once you are confident that your migration is safe, wrap
your migration in a safety_assured block.  See below:

  class MySafeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      safety_assured { remove_column :foo_table, :foo_column }
    end
  end

Have a nice day!
